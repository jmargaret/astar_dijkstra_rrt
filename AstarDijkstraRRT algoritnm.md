#`Astar`_`Dijkstra`_`RRT` algoritnm    

  
###Graduate design from MPIG.     

Here contains three folders, respectively, corresponding to the A* algorithm, Dijkstra algorithm, RRT algorithm. Programs run in an MATLAB environment.       

* astar
In the first AStar algorithm folder,add directory to MATLAB path. Run the entire program on the ASTAR_GUI interface.       
After you hit the run, select different types of maps on the pop-up interface, and set their starting points, targets, and obstacles. For more about Astar algorithms, see in the Astar.m file.        

* dijkstra
In the second dijkstra's algorithm folder,this is a simple Dijkstra algorithm program, run in the MATLAB environment.Add directory to MATLAB path. Run the main.m file.The code for the algorithm is explained in detail in Dijkstragrid.m. file.     
 

* rrt  
In the third rrt algorithm folder,Add directory to MATLAB path. Run the entire program on the RRT_gui.fig interface.    
After you hit the run, select different types of maps and other restrictions on the pop-up interface, and set their starting points, targets, and obstacles.    
For more about RRT algorithms, see in the RRTPlan.m file.
